## This project contains an example of a liquidity provider bot for Uniswap

### Create a new LP position (concentrated liquidity V3) on Uniswap:

- "...\master_all_v19_Uniswap_ARB_INITIALISE.js"
- It creates a new LP position and the user only needs to set the price range vs. the current price
- The code is for the WETH/USDC pair on the Arbitrum (ARB) chain.
- I developed more of these bots on several chains (BSC, BASE, Arbitrum) and these are available on request.
