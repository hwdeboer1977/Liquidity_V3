## This project contains an example of a liquidity provider bot for Orca

### Create a new LP position (concentrated liquidity V3) on Orca DEX:

- To open a LP position: use "...\open_position_solana_bot_1.ts".
- To close a LP position: use "...\close_position_solana_bot_1.ts".
- The other typescript (.ts) files are example files for transfer, swap etc.
- It creates a new LP position and the user only needs to set the price range vs. the current price.
- The code is for the SOL/USDC pair on the Solana chain.
