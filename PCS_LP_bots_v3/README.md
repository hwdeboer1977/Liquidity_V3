## This project contains an example of a liquidity provider bot for Pancakeswap

### Create a new LP position (concentrated liquidity V3) on Pancakeswap:

- "...\master_all_v18_PCS_BSC_INITIALISE_PCS_BOT_1.js"
- It creates a new LP position and the user only needs to set the price range vs. the current price
- The code is for the USDT/WBNB pair on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC).
- I developed more of these bots on several chains (BSC, BASE, Arbitrum) and these are available on request.

### The following file reads all the relevant information on an already created LP position on Pancakeswap:

- "...\get_overview_positions_PCS_BOT_1.js"
